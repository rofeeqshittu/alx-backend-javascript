# 0x05. NodeJS Basics

## Overview
This project is part of the **Back-end** track, focusing on the fundamentals of using Node.js for server-side JavaScript. The goal is to gain hands-on experience with core Node.js modules, the `Express.js` framework, and asynchronous programming.

Key skills developed in this project include:
- Running JavaScript code with Node.js.
- Building basic and advanced HTTP servers using Node.js and Express.js.
- Managing files synchronously and asynchronously.
- Using tools like `nodemon` and Babel for efficient development.
- Writing and testing code with Jest and linting with ESLint.
